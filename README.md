# ICE 04: The Other One

In this activity, you will complete a simplified version of A4, specifically using the option you did NOT chooose for that assignment.

### Instructions

1. Divide yourselves into groups of 3 - 5 students. Everybody in your group should have chosen the same option for A4 (creative coding OR components). **MAKE SURE TO REGISTER YOUR GROUP ON CANVAS** just as you've done with previous group assignments in this class.

2. Go to the version of A4 your group did not choose and complete the assignment with the following modifications:
    * **[Components](https://github.com/jmcuneo/a4-components-a25):** You should start with the existing submission for A2 or A3 for one of your group members.
    * **[Creative Coding](https://github.com/jmcuneo/a4-creative-coding-a25):** Your group should choose which of the technologies on the list you want to explore. You must choose at least one but can do more than one.
    * Discuss with your team what you think you can reasonably accomplish by the end of the class period. **As this is an in-class activity, we are NOT expecting the same level of complexity as A4,** although we are expecting you to demonstrate a basic understanding of the technologies in question. Do what you can with the time you have and take advantage of the fact that there are multiple people working on this (whereas A4 is an individual effort). This will be a bit of an exercise in time management, project estimation, and team communication.
    * Your README should include your hosting link, the name of all group members, **your group number**, the contributions of each group member, and any instructions necessary to use the application. You can ignore the points in A4 about goals and challenges.
    * I suggest one group member fork this assignment and then add the other group members as contributors.
    * You should submit a pull request against THIS assignment, NOT A4.

As a group, we divided up and each took our own technology for the Creative Coding Part of the assignment, where
Matthew Franco did D3, Maxwell Jeronimo did Three.js, and Ryan Nemeti did Tone.js.  Franco's part of the assignment
included
Jeronimo's part of the assignment included a clicking game, where your score would be kept track by how many cubes
you clicked that were falling from the sky, and if you missed 5 of the cubes the game would end.  The cubes would speed
up after a certain amount of time to retain some difficulty.
